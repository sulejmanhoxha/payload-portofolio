        I got into tech through gaming, which sparked my interest in Information
        Systems and Technology. I love web development and also dabble in mobile
        and desktop tech to create useful digital tools. Besides school, I enjoy
        messing around with Linux and learning about AI to see what it can do.

        Life isn&apos;t just about coding for me. I find happiness in simple
        stuff like watching movies, enjoying TV shows, and having deep talks
        over coffee with friends. Working in my dad&apos;s restaurant taught me
        how making people happy matters. Whether it&apos;s through a meal or a
        cool app, I aim to create experiences that make people feel good.
